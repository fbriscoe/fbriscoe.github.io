</head>
<body>
    <p>Yves Saint Laurent was born in Oran, French Algeria on August 1st ,1936. He had shown great talent for fashion design, and this led to him to work for Christian Dior and by 1957 at age 21, he became the head designer of the House of Dior after Christian Dior died prematurely of a heart attack.</body>p>
        <br/>
        <p>In 1961, he and his partner, industrialist Pierre Berg√©, started their own fashion house Yves Saint Laurent which became known for looks which were both comfortable and elegant so that women may be able to feel empowered. The fashion house changed the fashion industry in countless ways such as the creation of Le Smoking, a classic tuxedo suit for women which was created in 1966 which was a time where women would be looked down upon for wearing trousers. He was also one of the first Haute Couture houses to create Ready-to-Wear collections in 1967 which would be more accessible for more people due to the cheaper prices. He is best known for his work in the 60s and 70s and his influence of 80s fashion with the use of big shoulder padding in his 1978 collection.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>He was the first living designer to be honoured with a solo exhibition of his work in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1983. On June 1st, 2008, he died of brain cancer in his residence in Paris. </p>
